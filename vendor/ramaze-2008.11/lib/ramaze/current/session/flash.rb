    # The purpose of this class is to act as a unifier of the previous
    # and current flash.
    #
    # Flash means pairs of keys and values that are held only over one
    # request/response cycle. So you can assign a key/value in the current
    # session and retrieve it in the current and following request.
    #
    # Please see the FlashHelper for details on the usage as you won't need
    # to touch this class at all.
