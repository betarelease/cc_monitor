# rackup is a useful tool for running Rack applications, which uses the
# Rack::Builder DSL to configure middleware and build up applications easily.
#
# rackup automatically figures out the environment it is run in, and runs your
# application as FastCGI, CGI, or standalone with Mongrel or WEBrickâ€”all from
# the same configuration.
