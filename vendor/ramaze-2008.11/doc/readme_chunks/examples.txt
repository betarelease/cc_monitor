There are some examples for your instant pleasure inside the examples-directory
in the Ramaze-distribution.
To start up an example, you can use the Ramaze binary located in bin/ramaze 
for example:

  $ ramaze examples/hello.rb

Or:

  $ cd examples/blog
  $ ramaze

Since ramaze uses the start.rb by default if you don't pass anything else.

For more information about the usage of ramaze try:

  $ ramaze --help


Examples include:

* examples/hello.rb
  Hello, World!

* examples/simple.rb
  A bit more advanced than the hello-example, but still very basic.

* examples/blog
  Not yet fully functional, but coming along.

* examples/whywiki
  A basic examples of a minimalistic application, based on the Wiki of \_why in
  his camping-framework.

* examples/templates
  examples of real usage of the templating-engines. Tries to implement the same
  functionality in each `template_*.rb` file using a different engine.
