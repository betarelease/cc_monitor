There is a large number of people who made Ramaze possibe by their ongoing
efforts in the world of open source and by encouraging and helping me.

This list is by no means a full listing of all these people, but I try to
get a good coverage despite that.

I would like to thank:

* Yukihiro Matsumoto a.k.a matz

    For giving the world Ruby and bringing fun back into programming.

* Zed Shawn a.k.a. zedas

    For developing Mongrel, Ramaze started out as a simple Hello World based
    on that awesome server.

* Christian Neukirchen a.k.a chris2

    For building rack, which is just what the numerous web-developers had
    anticipated and which will, with no doubt, change the world.

* Pistos

    For continious encouragment and building the first real webpage on Ramaze.
    His bugreports were invaluable.

* Jim Weirich

    For Rake, which lifts off a lot of tasks from the shoulders of every
    developer who uses it.

* Thomas Sawyer a.k.a Trans

    Dragging me deep into the rabbit-hole and showing me how awesome Ruby
    truely is through his work on facets, ratchets and tons of other projects.

* George Moschovitis a.k.a gmosx

    For his tremendous efforts in the Nitro/Og framework, which is a source of
    steady inspiration for Ramaze and brought me to Ruby in the first place.

* Rob Levin a.k.a. lilo

    He founded the most excellent Freenode IRC-network, where the most important
    channels for rubyists are located (as is #ramaze).
    May he rest in peace.

* The guys (and gals) in the various channels on Freenode

    As the people are way too many to be listed, here the channels that i call
    my online home.
    All the people in there deserve special thanks for getting me hooked to Ruby
    and providing their help in a friendly and patient manner.

    * #nitro
    * #ruby-de
    * #ruby-lang
    * #rubyforce
