Now that you have a vague idea of what you're about to get into you might just
want to get a way to get up and running ASAP.
Please read below for more information about installation.

Depending on what you are planning to do you can either just go and start
reading the source or directly get some hands-on experience by trying some of
the examples.
Most things will require dependencies though. The basic functionality is
provided by the WEBrick adapter and the Template::Ramaze, which just run out
of the box. For more features you will have to install some templating-engines
and mongrel (_very_ recommended). Ramaze will inform you when it needs further
dependencies, so just go and try some things.

Some places to get started are:
- Read the documentation.
- Run and read the test cases.
- Look at the examples and run/modify them.
