Ramaze is a very simple and straight-forward web-framework.
The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of KISS and POLS, trying to
make simple things simple and complex things possible.

This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some ruby, but is often
forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features. Ramaze only tries to
give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achieve
perfect custom-tailored results.

Another one of the goals during development of Ramaze was to make every part as
modular and therefor reuasable as possible, not only to provide a basic
understanding after the first glance, but also to make it as simple as possible
to reuse parts of the code.

The original purpose of Ramaze was to act as a kind of framework to build
web-frameworks, this was made obsolete by the introduction of rack, which
provides this feature at a better level without trying to enforce any structural
layout of the resulting framework.
