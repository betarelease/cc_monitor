Ramaze Features:
  - Builds on top of the Rack library, which provides easy use of adapters like
    Mongrel, WEBrick, LiteSpeed, Thin, CGI or FCGI.

  - Supports a wide range of templating-engines like: Amrita2, Erubis, Haml,
    Liquid, Markaby, Remarkably and its own engine called Ezamar and (still
    unofficial) Nagoro.

  - Highly modular structure: you can just use the parts you like. This also
    means that it's very simple to add your own customizations.

  - A variety of helpers is already available, giving you things like advanced
    caching, OpenID-authentication or aspect-oriented programming for your
    controllers.

  - It is possible to use the ORM you like, be it Sequel, DataMapper,
    ActiveRecord, Og, Kansas or something more simplistic like DBI, or a
    wrapper around YAML::Store.

  - Good documentation: although we don't have 100% documentation right now
    (dcov says around 75%), just about every part of Ramaze is covered with
    basic and advanced docs. There are a variety of examples, screencasts and a
    tutorial available.

  - Friendly community: there are people from all over the world using Ramaze,
    so you can get almost instant help and info.
